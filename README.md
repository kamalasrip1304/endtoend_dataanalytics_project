# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analysis workflow** – starting from raw datasets, performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and finally creating visualizations to extract meaningful insights.  
The goal was to apply analytical thinking and programming skills to uncover trends and patterns that could support better decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **IDE/Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data Source**: CSV/Excel files  

## 🔍 What I Did
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Imported raw datasets in CSV format
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
   - Standardized column formats for consistency

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generated descriptive statistics and summary tables
   - Identified data distributions and trends
   - Explored correlations between variables

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps
   - Highlighted key insights through visual storytelling

4. **Insights & Outcomes**
   - Summarized major findings from the dataset
   - Derived data-driven conclusions

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization & storytelling  
- Python for analytics  
- Problem solving & critical thinking
